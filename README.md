This is me, learning to code in Java and writing this code after learning and understanding it from the book Headfirst Java, it's a new journey for me and i plan on documenting every code i practice.

Unlike the typical Hello world, i dived into Java larning about loops and i must say it's very similar to c++, i was learning c++ and still learning and i think learning Java also would solidify my underdstanding of c++ and although they have slight differeneces in syntax, i believe i can be able to make it work, and make learning fun as i go.
